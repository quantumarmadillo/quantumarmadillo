- 👋 Hi, I’m Vapor One Eternal. I use Quantum Armadillo based on the Olympus WS-822, personally.
  
- 👀 I like looking at different things to examine patterns. Things like Chinese characters, source code, time cycles, etc.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make themed audio packs.

- 💞️ **I thought it'd be nice to let the world know that if they get an Olympus WS-821, WS-822, or WS-823 and WITHOUT modifying it, adding 198 folders to the MUSIC folder, each folder with 200 MP3's. Like a soundboard library in ANY LANGUAGE. SETTINGS >> PLAY MODE >> MUSIC to RANGE ALL, REPEAT ON, RANDOM ON. It's psychic and FAST!** [SETUP INFO](/SETUP)

- 📫 I'm BUSY. I'm not responding to messages.

- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever. Be clever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Spock actually had 3 ears.
