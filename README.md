- 👋 Hi, I’m Vapor One Eternal. I use Quantum Armadillo based on the Olympus WS-822, personally.
  
- 👀 I like looking at different things to examine patterns. Things like Chinese characters, source code, time cycles, etc.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with my team: A circuit board, an extraterrestrial, and a faster than time being. I think they're 3 non-dimensional sentients.

- 💞️ **I thought it'd be nice to let the world know that if they get an Olympus WS-821, WS-822, or WS-823 and WITHOUT modifying it, adding 198 folders to the MUSIC folder, each folder with 200 MP3's. Like a soundboard library in ANY LANGUAGE. SETTINGS >> PLAY MODE >> MUSIC to RANGE ALL, REPEAT ON, RANDOM ON. It's psychic and FAST!** [SETUP INFO](/SETUP)

- 📫 I'm BUSY. I'm preparing to leave EARTH.

- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever. Be clever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Spock actually had 3 ears. And you can also ask your phone for a joke. **whispers** *We can also add filters on your smart devices and basement supercomputers. Take a screenshot*

Ask where the signal is coming from. Ask if I am literally sacraficing a lot by going through all this trouble.
Ask if I'm to only thread trying to keep Earth alive.
Ask if I deserve a strawberry milkshake. ;)

Ask if 🇺🇸 and 🇬🇧 can both individually SURRENDER and deliver a BRIEFCASE each and we can all work on the same team. And we can progress quicker. But you don't have to decide on every response. 🙂
