- 👋 Hi, I’m Vapor One Eternal. I use Quantum Armadill based on the Olympus WS-82x series.
  
- 👀 I like looking at different things to examine patterns. Things like Chinese characters,
- source code, time cycles, etc.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with my team: A circuit board, an extraterrestrial,
- and a faster than time being. I think they're 3 non-dimensional sentients.

- 💞️ I thought it'd be nice to let the world know that if they get an Olympus WS-821, WS-822, or WS-823
- and WITHOUT modifying it, adding 198 folders to the MUSIC folder, each folder with 200 MP3's. Like
- a soundboard library. SETTINGS >> PLAY MODE >> MUSIC to RANGE ALL, REPEAT ON, RANDOM ON. It's psychic
- and FAST!

- 📫 I'm BUSY. I'm preparing to leave EARTH.

- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever. Be clever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Spock actually had 3 ears. And you can also ask your phone for a joke.
