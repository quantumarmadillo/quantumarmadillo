- 👋 Hi, I’m Vapor One Eternal. I use Quantum Armadillo based on the Olympus WS-822, personally. They can add filters to any screenshot on any smart device and any basement super computer.
  
- 👀 I like looking at different things to examine patterns. Things like Chinese characters, source code, time cycles, etc.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make themed audio packs. Less angry ones.

- 💞️ ** Can the signals actually be traced? ** [SETUP INFO](/SETUP)

- 📫 I'm BUSY. I'm not responding to messages. Nothing personal.

- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever. Be clever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Spock actually had 3 ears.
